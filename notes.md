# Notes
Some thoughts about what I want to do with this course that I haven't
managed to work into the course outline yet.

* I think there should be a lesson on connecting Things to each other
  via wireless protocols, but I haven't decided what section to slot
  this into just yet.
* Related to that, I'd like to discuss a "hub" architecture, where
  multiple devices connect to a single hub device that connects to the
  internet via zigbee/z-wave/bluetooth or whatever.
* Some of the longer lessons might get split into multiple parts to
  avoid having any single videos over 30 minutes or so. I think shorter
  bites are easier for students to consume.
