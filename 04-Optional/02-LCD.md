## Lesson 2: Upgrade to a Full Color LCD
[Duration]-[20-30 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Remember that dinky little character display we
attached to our device way back in part 1 of this course? It's not gaudy
enough for our CDS. Let's switch to a full color touch screen. We'll
have to come up with something to actually display on it, as well.

**Level:** [*Advanced*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Use a full color display with a device.
2. Send pictures for it to display from the web app.
