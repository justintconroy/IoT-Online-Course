## Lesson 5: Intro to Low Level Communication Protocols
[Duration]-[20-25 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Not all sensors will be as simple to plug in as a
button or a photoresistor. Some of them need to give you a lot more
information than a single value. Sometimes, you'll even need to send
information back to those devices, or configure them in some way. There
are a few low level communication protocols used in electronic devices
to accomplish this communication. In this lesson, we'll go over a few of
them.

**Level:** [*Intermediate*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. What is SPI
2. What is I2C
3. Name one or more other low level protocols
3. Give examples of components using some of these protocols
