## Lesson 2: Arduino Programming
[Duration]-[20-30 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Now that we have a basic understanding of electronic
circuits, we can do more with these things by introducing some
microcontrollers. We'll use the Arduino Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) to program our ESP32's.

**Level:** [*Intermediate*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Write and Upload code with the Arduino IDE
2. Turn on an LED with a microcontroller
3. Read a button input from an Arduino program
