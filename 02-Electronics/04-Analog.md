## Lesson 4: Using the Analog Pins
[Duration]-[10-15 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** The analog pins on a microcontroller are used for
reading voltage levels given by external devices and components. In this
lesson, we'll build a simple circuit with a photoresistor to learn how
to use an analog component in your code.

**Level:** [*Intermediate*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Use analog components in your devices
