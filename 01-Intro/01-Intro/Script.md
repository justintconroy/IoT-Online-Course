# Lesson 1: Introduction to IoT and Course Outline
## Hello
Hello students!

Welcome to IoT with the Cloud.


## What is This Course?
In this course, we'll be learning about the Internet of Things.


## Who am I?
I'm your host, Justin.

I'm a software developer and electronics engineer.

I like playing with robots and other electronics.

I've been developing software for various companies for almost a decade.

And I've been playing around with microcontrollers
and robots for longer than that.


## Who are You?/What Are You Expected to Already Know?
This is an intermediate level course.

If you've signed up for this course, it's expected that
you have a basic knowledge of electronics, microcontrollers
and programming.


## What is IoT?
IoT stands for The Internet of Things.

The "Things" are generally devices in the home or workplace that are
connected to the internet.

You'll often find these things advertized as "Smart" devices.

Simply put, IoT is a term for a system of interconnected devices.

## IoT Examples
You can find examples of IoT or Smart devices everywhere these days.

Smart TVs, Smart Fridges, Smart Ass, Smart Light Bulbs.

You can find IoT devices in cars, hospitals, factories.

Even on farms.


## Privacy/Security Concerns
There are a few security and privacy issues associated with IoT Devices.

You might have heard of incidents in the news that sound something like

"Millions of lightbulbs were hacked and made part of a botnet to mine bitcoin"

Not to mention all of the internet connected cameras that hackers take
over and watch people in their homes.

These are serious issues, and we will be addressing them at some point
in the course.


## What Will You Learn in This Course?
In this course, you'll learn how to build an internet connected device,

and eventually how to build a web app to interact with it.

For most of the lessons, we'll be using an ESP32 as our microcontroller.

At the start of the course, we'll connect our device

to an app called Blynk to start things off simple.

Later, we'll replace Blynk with our own web app.

In this course, I'll be using C# and ASP.Net to build the web app.

When we're ready for it, I'll be showing you how to host your app on Azure.


## Class Project
Throughout this course, I'll be referencing a course project.

We'll be building a device as part of the lessons.

It will eventually become a whole ecosystem of sensors and actuators.

It will give you a solid foundation for building IoT applications.

You can build along at home, but it may be cost prohibitive to buy all

the components we're going to use throughout the course.

So, building your own is optional, but highly encouraged.

You can always pick and choose the components you are most interested in

and just build those parts of the project.

By the end of the course, you should be comfortable using a wide range

of components for your devices.

Everything we do for the project can be done at home without any specialized equipment.

After each lesson where we add new capabilities to our ecosystem,

we'll discuss how this information applies to industrial applications

and how you can adapt it.

## Bye
So, that's the course in a nutshell.

See you in the next lesson!
