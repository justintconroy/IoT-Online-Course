# Lesson 1: Introduction to IoT and Course Outline
## Hello
Hello students!

Welcome to IoT with the Cloud.


## What is This Course?
In this course, we'll be learning about the Internet of Things.


## Who am I?
I'm your host, Justin.

I'm a software developer and electronics engineer.

I like playing with robots and other electronics.

I've been developing software for various companies for almost a decade.

And I've been playing around with microcontrollers
and robots for longer than that.


## Who are You?/What Are You Expected to Already Know?
This is an intermediate level course.

If you've signed up for this course, it's expected that
you have a basic knowledge of electronics, microcontrollers
and programming.


## What is IoT?
IoT stands for The Internet of Things.

The "Things" are generally devices in the home or workplace that are
connected to the internet.

You'll often find these things advertized as "Smart" devices.

Simply put, IoT is a term for a system of interconnected devices.

## IoT Examples
You can find examples of IoT or Smart devices everywhere these days.

Smart TVs, Smart Fridges, Smart Ass, Smart Light Bulbs.

You can find IoT devices in cars, hospitals, factories.

Even on farms.


## Privacy/Security Concerns
There are a few security and privacy issues associated with IoT Devices.

You might have heard of incidents in the news that sound something like

"Millions of lightbulbs were hacked and made part of a botnet to mine bitcoin"

Not to mention all of the internet connected cameras that hackers take
over and watch people in their homes.

These are serious issues, and we will be addressing them at some point
in the course.
