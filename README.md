Automate Anything and connect to it anywhere
AUTHOR: Justin T. Conroy

## About the Author
Justin received his bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2010. He’s been playing with small computers and
robots for more than a decade, and he’s been working as a software developer in
industry for almost as long.

## About the Course
In this course, you'll learn how to build devices that connect to the
internet and the cloud. This expects you to already know some basic
programming and electronics skills as a prerequisite. So, we won't cover
basic principles about electronics, microcontrollers, and programming.

Throughout the course, we'll be building a home and garden automation
system. Each lesson will build on previous lessons to add new
capabilities to our system.
