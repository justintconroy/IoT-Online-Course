# Industrial IoT and the Cloud
Automate Anything and connect to it anywhere
AUTHOR: Justin T. Conroy

## About the Author
Justin received his bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2010. He’s been playing with small computers and
robots for more than a decade, and he’s been working as a software developer in
industry for almost as long.

## About the Course
This course will take you from complete beginner with electronics and the Internet of
Things to being able to create your own connected devices and control them from the
cloud. This is not an “introduction to programming” course, so some skill in that area
is expected as a prerequisite to this course. Students won’t be expected to know how to
work with electronic circuits prior to taking this course. Much of that will be explained
throughout the course. Though a working knowledge of electricity and basic components would
be very helpful in this course.

There will be an ongoing project throughout the course. As we acquire
new skills, we'll add on to this project to make more interesting
systems.
