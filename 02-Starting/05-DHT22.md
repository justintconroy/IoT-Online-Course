## Lesson 5: Track Environmental Conditions Using the DHT22 Humidity/Temperature Sensor
[Duration]-[10-20 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Your plants will do better in the right environmental
conditions. That's why we'll start tracking the temperature and humidity
of the surrounding environment. We can do this with the DHT-22 sensor.
We can then use Blynk to plot these data points over time so we get the
full picture of what's happening with our plant buddies.

**Level:** [*Basic*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Use the DHT-22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor.
2. Plot sensor data in the Blynk App.
