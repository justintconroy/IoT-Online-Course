## Lesson 2: Add a Display Panel to Your Device
[Duration]-[5-10 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** In this lesson, we'll add an LCD character display to
our device. We can potentially use this to debug our device when it's
not connected to a computer, but mostly we'll be using it to send ourselves
dirty jokes.

**Level:** [*Basic*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Using an LCD Character Display.
2. Sending text from Blynk to your device.
