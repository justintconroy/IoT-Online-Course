[Duration]-[20-30 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Now that we've got something to talk to, we need a way
to actually do the talking. MQTT is a simple messaging protocol that's
commonly used in IoT applications. We'll setup an MQTT server, and
modify code on our web app and on our device to start using that to talk
to each other. By the end of this lesson, we should see that graph
updating on the web app! ðŸ˜¸
