## Lesson 1: Create a Web App Mimicking Our Blynk App
[Duration]-[20-30 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** Alright, now we're really starting to get into the meat
and potatoes of this course. Let's take all those things we did in Blynk
and put them in our own custom web application. This lesson will only
cover setting up the DHT-22 sensor. Implementing the rest of the components
we've already worked with is left as an exercise to the viewer. Also,
we're only going to setup the plumbing here. Actually connecting to our
device will be in Lesson 2. ðŸ˜¸

**Level:** [*Intermediate*]

**Skills Learned:**
1. Build a web app.
2. Show a graph of Temperature and Humidity on that web app.
