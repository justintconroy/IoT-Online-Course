# Section 3: Create a Custom Web App to Talk to Your Device
Blynk is great for simple use cases where you just want to use your
phone to interact with your device, but we can do so much more if we
build our own custom application. In this section, we'll start putting
together the building blocks of our new custom app. We're going to start
out by making a console application running locally. We'll make sure to
organize our code so that we can easily reuse these building blocks when
we start building our web application in the next section.
