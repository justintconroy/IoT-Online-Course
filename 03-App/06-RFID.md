## Lesson 6: Securely Disable the LOUD NOISES With RFID
[Duration]-[10-20 minutes]

**DESCRIPTION:** By now, you're probably finding that cat alarm that we
added earlier to be pretty annoying. Just going off every time you go to
water your plant buddies. You might have even unplugged it by now! Well,
there's another way to disable the alarm and even keep your cat from
turning it off when you're not around. You can use an RFID tag to let
the device know that it's you there and disable the noise temporarily.
Unauthorized users and cats won't be able to disable the alarm, so
you won't have to worry about them sneaking in and chewing on your plant
buddies.
